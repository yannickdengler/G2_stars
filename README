This code calculates the parameteres of the piecewise polytropes of the equations of state EoS I-III and of the light and heavy dark matter candidate equation of state from G2 gauge theory used in https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19691 and uses them in the TOV equation to get mass, radius, tidal deformability and other parameters of mixed neutron stars. 
The directory 'EoS' contains Wolfram Mathematica skripts that calculate the parameters of piecewise polytropes. The results are initially alread saved in 'EoS/output'. Next, main.sh calls the main python script 'run.py' for different combinations of equations of state. The first variable is the mass of the dark matter candidate in MeV, the second is the stepsize of the integration which is chosen empirically and the last varible denotes the combination of ordinary- and dark matter equation of state. The range of central pressures investigated and the number thereof can be chosen in run.py. 
Afterwards, 'main_plot.sh' calls the plotting skripts used in Yannick Denglerâ€™s PhD thesis.
